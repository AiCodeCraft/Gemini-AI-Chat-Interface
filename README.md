## Features

- **Chat with Gemini Models**: Supports various Gemini models, including vision-enabled ones.
- **Image Analysis**: Upload images to enhance the conversation with AI. Like with Flash 1.5
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust temperature, max tokens, and add system prompts for tailored interactions.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit for an intuitive user experience.
- **Uee your own API-Key**
